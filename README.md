# Crunchyroll Advanced Search

A powerful web application for searching and filtering Crunchyroll's anime catalog with features that Crunchyroll doesn't provide.

## 🎯 Why This Project Exists

Crunchyroll's built-in search is limited and lacks advanced filtering capabilities. This project solves that by providing:

- **Advanced Filtering**: Filter by genres, tags, studios, content descriptors, and more
- **Enhanced Metadata**: Integrates AniList data for comprehensive anime information
- **Tri-State Filters**: Include, exclude, or ignore specific criteria
- **Better Discovery**: Find exactly what you want with granular search options
- **Rich Information**: See both Crunchyroll and AniList ratings, years, tags, and studios

Crunchyroll's metadata is often incomplete. We enhance it with data from AniList to give you:
- Genre classifications
- Detailed tags (350+ unique tags)
- Studio information
- Release status
- Additional ratings and popularity metrics

## ✨ Features

### Search & Filter
- **Text Search**: Search by title or description
- **Genre Filters**: Include/exclude specific genres
- **Tag Filters**: 900+ tags with searchable list
- **Studio Filters**: Filter by animation studio
- **Status Filters**: Filter by release status (Releasing, Finished, Not Yet Released)
- **Content Descriptors**: Filter by content warnings
- **Basic Filters**: Mature content, dubbed, subbed, minimum rating

### User Experience
- **Collapsible Sections**: Clean, organized filter interface
- **Result Counts**: See how many anime match each filter
- **Active Filter Tracking**: Display of active filters in section headers
- **Clickable Tags**: Click any tag to add it as a filter
- **Pagination**: Adjustable results per page (16, 32, 64, 128)
- **Sorting**: Adjustable sorting order (alphabetical, Crunchyroll launch year, ratings)
- **Direct Links**: Click anime cards to go straight to Crunchyroll

### Data Quality
- **Daily Updates**: Automatic updates from Crunchyroll's catalog
- **Change Tracking**: Logs of what anime were added/removed
- **Snapshot Timestamps**: Know when the data was last updated
- **Dual Ratings**: Both Crunchyroll and AniList ratings displayed

## 🔄 Automated Updates

The anime catalog updates automatically every day at 1:00 AM EDT via systemd timer:

- Fetches latest data from Crunchyroll
- Enhances with AniList metadata using fuzzy matching
- Validates API format changes (fails safely)
- Creates pull requests automatically
- Auto-merges after validation
- Tracks additions, removals, and changes
- Maintains change logs for analysis

See [DATA_UPDATE_SETUP.md](DATA_UPDATE_SETUP.md) for details.

## 🤖 Built with AI

This project was developed primarily using **Claude Code** (Anthropic's Claude AI) and **Playwright MCP** (Model Context Protocol).

### Development Process

- **AI-Powered Development**: Most of the code, architecture, and features were created through conversations with Claude Code
- **Playwright MCP**: Used for browser automation and testing during development
- **Iterative Refinement**: UI/UX improvements were guided by real-time testing and feedback
- **Human-AI Collaboration**: Project direction and decisions made collaboratively

### What Claude Built

- Complete React/TypeScript frontend with tri-state filtering system
- Extensible component architecture that auto-updates with new data
- Python scripts for data fetching and AniList enhancement
- GitHub Actions workflows for automated updates and deployment
- Comprehensive documentation and contribution guidelines
- UI/UX design with responsive layouts and dark theme

This showcases how AI can be used as a powerful development tool while maintaining high code quality and following best practices.
